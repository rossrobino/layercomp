## Theme

Below is the default theme. The `base` OKLCH palette will be calculated with [relative color syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Relative_colors) based on the **color**, **lightness**, and **chroma** values you provide with custom properties. You can use any color function, you do not have to use hexadecimal. uico will automatically apply a light or dark [color scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) based on your theme.

You can use or override any of uico's custom properties in your CSS. View the [theme layer](https://github.com/rossrobino/uico/tree/main/packages/uico/style.css) to see a full list of custom properties uico sets. Most of sizing values are based on [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) values.

Check out the [OKLCH color generator](/color-generator) or the [pre-made palettes](https://github.com/rossrobino/uico/tree/main/packages/uico/colors) for inspiration.
